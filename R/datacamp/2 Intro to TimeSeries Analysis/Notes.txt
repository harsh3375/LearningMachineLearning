Predicting the future
	>	Trend Splotting
			- log() : can linearize a rapid growth trend
			- diff(x) : can remove a linear trend
			- diff(x, s) : seasonal difference transformation
			
	>	White Noise Model
			- fixed, constant mean
				- series having upward or downward trend
				  the mean changes with time
			- fixed, constant variance
			- no correlation over time
				- series having periodic pattern has correlation
				
			- simulating WN : arima.sim(model=c(0,0,0), n, mean, sd)
			- esimating WN model : arima(x, order=c(0,0,0))
	
	>	Random Walk - RW = ARIMA(0,1,0)
			- example of non-stationary process
			- no specified mean or variance
			- strong dependence over time
			- its changes or increments are white noise
			- Y_t = Y_t-1 + e ;	e = mean zero white noise
			- has on only one parameter, variance of white noise
			- Y_t - Y_t-1 = e , white noise with mean 0
				i.e diff(Y) = WN
				
			- RW with Drift
				- Y_t = C + Y_t-1 + e , two parameters C and variance
				- Y_t - Y_t-1 = C + e , WN with mean C
	
	>	Stationary Process
			- Weak Stationarity
				- mean, variance, covariance constant over time
				- RW not weak stationary as its variance depends on T
				- WN is stationary
