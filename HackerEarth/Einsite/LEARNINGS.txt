- Missing Data (missing.R)
	- use the column subset of the data with no missing values 
	  to impute the missing values in other columns. Combine the 
	  train and test+predicted values so that you have more data.
	  
- Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.R)
	- Have a separate script for working on the features
	- Save the engineered features
	- Verify if the categorical variables that are converted 
	  into numeric have the same mapping in test and train
	
- Model Creation (<model>.R)
	- Use the saved data. Don't impute or engineer features here
	- Regression
		- Removing the <0.01 and >99.99 improved
		  the correlation and thus the model accuracy
		- Interactions !!!
	- XGBoost
		- 
	- Prediction
		- Check for predictions which are not sensible
			ex: negative price . And translate them into
		  least/maximum possible values
